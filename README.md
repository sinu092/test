Version Control System (VCS) is a software that helps software developers to work together and maintain a complete history of their work.
Listed below are the functions of a VCS −
•	Allows developers to work simultaneously.
•	Does not allow overwriting each other’s changes.
•	Maintains a history of every version.
Following are the types of VCS −
•	Centralized version control system (CVCS).
•	Distributed/Decentralized version control system (DVCS).
Step 1: install git 
Check version 
$git  --version
Setting username
git config --global user.name "shrinivas.h"
Setting email id
git config --global user.email "shrinivas.halhalli@gmail.com"

General workflow is as follows −
•	You clone the Git repository as a working copy.
•	You modify the working copy by adding/editing files.
•	If necessary, you also update the working copy by taking other developer's changes.
•	You review the changes before commit.
•	You commit changes. If everything is fine, then you push the changes to the repository.
•	After committing, if you realize something is wrong, then you correct the last commit and push the changes to the repository.
